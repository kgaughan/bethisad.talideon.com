This repo contains an Ansible deployment playbook for the site
bethisad.talideon.com__, which is a `River of News`__ style aggregator for the
`Ill Bethisad`__ alternate history community.

It's powered by the `Planet Venus`__ aggregator.

Adding your site
================

If you wish to be included in the aggregator, consider making a pull request
to modifying ``templates/config.ini.j2``, adding a section with the URL and
name of your site. For instance::

    [https://example.com/feed/]
    name = Example News, International Edition

This site is purely intended as an aggregator, which is the reason why I've
this in the header::

    <meta name="robots" content="noindex,follow"/>

That means `links are followed, but the page isn't indexed`__.

Moreover, if you only want an excerpt from your posts included, be sure to
include the `excerpt.py` filter in your section::

    filters = excerpt.py

Alternatively, if you're on Twitter, ping me at `@talideon`__.
